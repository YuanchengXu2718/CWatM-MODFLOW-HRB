# CWatM-MODFLOW-HRB-model

This is the coupled surface water-groundwater (CWatM-MODFLOW 6) model developed for the Hai River basin (HRB).  

Its key improvement over the standard CWatM is an advanced water allocation algorithm that accounts for inter-basin transfers and conjunctive use complexities.
